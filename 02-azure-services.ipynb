    "\n",
    "Most Azure managed services are fairly straightforward to enable logging for, but some of them are a bit more complex. This section will cover the most common services and how to enable logging for them.\n",

    "\n",
    "These services all follow the same pattern. They all have a \"diagnostic settings\" blade in the portal, where you can select which logs you want to send to which destination. The most common destinations are Log Analytics, Event Hub, and Storage Account.\n",

This is a better solution, as it means that the connection string will be encrypted at rest and won't be in plain text in the repo. It also means that we can change the connection string between environments. This is a good solution for production workloads.\n",
